## ‚ùî How to Use the Issue Tracker

This repository serves as the central hub for reporting issues, requesting new features, and tracking the progress of ongoing development. Please make sure to check existing issues before submitting a new one to avoid duplicates.

**Note to Contributors**: You don't need to worry about specifying these labels/components when submitting an issue or feature request. Our team will assign the appropriate labels based on the details you provide. Just focus on giving a clear and detailed description of the problem or request.

### üè∑Ô∏è Issue Labels

We use labels to categorize and prioritize issues. Here are some of the key labels you might see:

- **duplicate**: This issue or request has already been reported and exists elsewhere in the tracker.
- **enhancement**: A request for a new feature or improvement.
- **help wanted**: We could use some assistance on this issue.
- **invalid**: The issue is not valid, possibly due to incorrect information, or is not relevant to the project.

- **wont fix**: The issue is acknowledged but will not be addressed or resolved, often due to being out of scope or not aligning with project goals.
